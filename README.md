Things that may need to be looked at

1. Require button images for undo/reset
3. Expert difficulty does not have a undo button
4. Number of moves has yet to be done - history log/leaderboard
5. Font sizing for novice is inconsistent
6. Counter needs to fixed
7. Think of stuff for difficulty
8. Look into multiplayer - dual listeners
